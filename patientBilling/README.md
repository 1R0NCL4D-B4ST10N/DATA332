# 📌 Patient Billing Data Analysis

## 📋 Overview  
This R script (`patientBillingTables.R`) processes and visualizes patient billing data by integrating information from three key tables: **Patients, Visits, and Billing**. The script merges datasets, extracts insights, and generates graphical representations of medical visit trends and billing activity.

## 📂 Data Sources  
The script relies on three key datasets:

### 📝 Billing Table

|-------------|--------------------------------|
| **InvoiceNum**  | Unique identifier for an invoice |
| **VisitID**    | Links to the corresponding patient visit |
| **InvoiceDate** | Date of billing |
| **InvoiceAmt**  | Total invoice amount |
| **InvoiceItem** | Description of the billed service |
| **InvoicePaid** | Boolean indicating if the invoice was paid |

### 👤 Patient Table  
The patient table stores demographic and contact information for individuals who have visited the medical facility.

| Column       | Description                                    |

| **Email**      | Contact email address |

### 📅 Visit Table  
The visit table logs medical visits, including the reason for the visit, whether it was a walk-in, and the date of the visit.

| Column       | Description                                    |
|-------------|--------------------------------|
| **VisitID**  | Unique identifier for each visit |
| **PatientID**  | References the associated patient |
| **VisitDate** | Date of the medical visit |
| **Reason**  | Medical reason for the visit |
| **WalkIn**  | Boolean indicating if the visit was a walk-in |
